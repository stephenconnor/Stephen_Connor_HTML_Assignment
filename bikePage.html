<p>The Venge is a pure-science mind wrapped in a lay-down-the-law body. With a one-two punch of Shiv inspired aerodynamics and Tarmac-borne stiffness, this machine was built to fly. With multiple World Tour victories under its belt, the FACT carbon frame and supreme handling delivers the winning formula of aero, light weight, and stiffness. With a measured 22 watts of free power at 40km/hr over the Tarmac, it’s tailor-made for serious performers who like to crush competitors’ dreams and break spirits into tiny pieces.</p> <p class="carouselDirectionText">click on image for further info</p></div></a>

<p>Rake Shift
An innovative highlight of the fork has a patent-pending: the adjustable trail "Rake Shift". A simple rotation of the adjusters in the dropouts allows a change of 5 mm. In this way the characteristics of the Aeroad CF can be adjusted from sporty- agile to well balanced and perfectly on track.
VCLS Aero Post
The oval VCLS Aero Post is made of carbon and basalt fibers and combines an aerodynamic design with maximum comfort levels and perfect geometry adjustment. The saddle sits on slide which is adjustable by 20 mm. The seat clamp is completely in the slipstream of the top tube and perfectly clamps the post.
Aeroblade SL
Besides having the most streamlined shape, the Aeroblade Carbon fork with patented fork crown, makes safety and comfort its highest priority. Basalt fibres flex much better than conventional carbon fibres. Thanks to the i-Lock headset system there is no need any more to drill into the steer tube or to use an Ahead clamp.
Internally routed cables
Internally routed cables not only provide a clean look and smooth shifting, but also prevent wind turbulences directly at the frame. Special feature: Even when the cables are not under tension, they support each other and hence do not rattle in the down tube. How? Through the crossed routing inside the frame. </p> <p class="carouselDirectionText">click on image for further info</p></div></a>

Ribble R872 Carbon Road Frame

<p>The R872 (developed from our award winning Ribble Stealth) is a high modulus T800 Toray carbon fibre race bike. The R872 has been designed with stiffness as a priority. The main areas of flex, headtube, bottom bracket have been bulked up with extra layers of carbon to reduce flex and the chainstays are 40mm deep. This gives a very rigid and responsive ride perfect for road racing and fast riding.

BB30 bottom bracket - a new standard that is stiffer, lighter and narrower than traditional bottom bracket systems.

Asymmetric 1-1/8" top & 1-1/2" bottom head tube for extra front-end stiffness.

- Internal brake cable routing
- Superior frame stiffness-to-weight ratio STW 105

Rated 4.5/5 in Bike Radar Review. What Bike Radar said:
"Were we able to score a bike 11 out of 10 for value, this would be it"
"Unbelievable value racer-cum-sportive machine and very light too"
"Acceleration is virtually instant, it's extremely fast, climbs superbly..."
"The handling is also extremely sharp, and it corners confidently and quickly..."</p><p class="carouselDirectionText">click on image for further info</p></div></a>

                                <h4>Colnago C59 Italia</h4>
                               <p> The C59 Italia is the pin­na­cle of the 2014 Colnago range. A cus­tom made 100% car­bon fibre rac­ing machine designed, built and painted in Italy. With a frame weigh­ing approx­i­mately 1000g it fea­tures an inter­nally ribbed top tube shaped sim­i­lar to the iconic Colnago Master frame. Frame effi­ciency is fur­ther increased by the use of spe­cific square sec­tion chain­stays and seatstays.
Two ver­sions are avail­able: One for elec­tronic shift­ing sys­tems such as Shimano Di2/Campagnolo EPS, and one for tra­di­tional mechan­i­cal shift­ing sys­tems. Small fea­tures on each type of frame are changed sub­tly to ensure that the ride qual­ity, per­for­mance and reli­a­bil­ity are iden­ti­cal, no mat­ter which one you choose.
Light, strong and effi­cient it is made to fit you per­fectly and is the result of decades of expe­ri­ence and knowl­edge in pro­duc­ing lugged car­bon fibre bicy­cle chas­sis. This allows the Colnago engi­neer­ing knowl­edge and vast lev­els of expe­ri­ence to be applied to every rider of a C59 Italia, ensur­ing you are rewarded with a ride that is beyond comparison.</p><p class="carouselDirectionText">click on image for further info</p></div></a>
